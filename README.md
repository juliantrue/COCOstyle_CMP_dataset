# COCOstyle CMP Facades Dataset
This repo provides the [CMP dataset](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~tylecr1/facade/) in format convenient for training Deep Neural Networks. Without a standard dataset format, it can be quite tedious writing new parsers for each new dataset. [The COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#home) provides a reusable approach to dataset formatting and hence, I have converted the popular facade database to this format to save time.
